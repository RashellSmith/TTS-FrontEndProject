HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap Project

Choose one of the three example sites included in the folder "Example Sites".
Using what you've learned with HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap, mimic the example site you choose as closely as possible in the time alloted.
When building your version of the site, don't worry about making it exactly the same to the pixel. Instead, focus on creating the same structure, sections, text/images, etc.
Don't forget to utilize quick tools available to you, like Bootstrap's components. 

You can use the template files included or, if you want to, you can start from scratch.
