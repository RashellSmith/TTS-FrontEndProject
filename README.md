# TTS Front-End Project
[Live](https://rashellsmith.github.io/TTS-FrontEndProject/)

The purpose of this assignment was to recreate a website of my choosing  using the technologies we learned in class. I chose The Hartford's website's about us page and tried to recreate it using html and css.

3. Footer (incomplete)\
    i. Links\
    ii. Aside elements



### Mistakes

I did try my best to complete the project in the allotted time. The site that I choose proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated. Because of that I did not complete the project but will be continually updating and improving my copy site.

### Structure 
I decided to use mainly CSS and html with basic bootstrap classes and JavaScript.\ 
 --CSS I laid out my styles from global to specific elements
 --HTML I used added the elements as I went.

### Changes
If I were to start this project over or had more time I would have used a CSS compiler like sass or used a javascript framework for modularity .
